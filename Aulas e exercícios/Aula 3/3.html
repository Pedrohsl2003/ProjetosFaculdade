    </p>
    <p>
        Ah, shit, I'm just workin' in the studio<br>
        I'm okay<br>

        You always talkin' about it, you never makin' no<br>
        profit, uh<br>
        I treat my hoes like a option, if she talkin' and get<br>
        out of pocket<br>
        I'm livin' life like a rockstar, pullin' up stretch<br>
        limousine<br>
        To look at me, that cost a fee, them double C's all<br>
        on my feet<br>
        You always talkin' about it, yeah, you always<br>
        talkin' about it<br>
        You say that you rockin' a private, yeah, but I see<br>
        that you cap about it<br>
        Livin' life like a rockstar, pullin' up stretch<br>
        limousine<br>
        To look at me, that cost a fee, them double C's all<br>
        on my feet

        I change my color to Nipsey blue<br>
        Your racks looking smaller, that shit pitiful<br>
        If you tryna get so physical<br>
        That .45 will make you invisible<br>
        I'm living my life like a criminal<br>
        I call that shit first 48<br>
        We quiet, there's no one to blame, yeah<br>
        My lawyer say: We beat the case<br>
        I'm livin' my life, celebration<br>
        I'm thankin' the Lord, I got patience<br>
        I'm lovin' the way that she take it<br>
        I bend it, I fold it, I flip it<br>
        She bringing it back just to prove it (prove it)<br>
        I'm giving her work just to move it, yeah<br>
        I'm living a life that I'm choosin', yeah<br>
        I'm getting these racks, getting stoopid, yeah
